Predictive Maintenance in Manufacturing
- Objective: Predict equipment failure in a manufacturing setting to schedule maintenance before failures occur.
- Dataset: [NASA Turbofan Engine Degradation Simulation Data] (https://www.kaggle.com/behrad3d/nasa-cmaps)
- Short Description: Use sensor data to predict when manufacturing equipment will fail, allowing for preventive maintenance and minimizing downtime.
- Guidelines:
- Preprocess sensor data and create features indicating wear and tear.
- Train models like Random Forest, XG-Boost, or LSTM for failure prediction.
- Deploy the model to generate real-time alerts for maintenance teams.
- Tips:
- Ensure that the model can handle different types of equipment with varied sensor data.
- Focus on minimizing false positives to avoid unnecessary maintenance.
